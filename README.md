# AI-Wordle-Project
A project that uses AI to play the Wordle game. 
This was done as a project for the Introduction to AI course at HUJI.


In this project we used a number of different methods to solve the Wordle game. These methods include:
1. Random and Total random algorithms
2. Adversarial algorithms which induce Minimax with alpha-beta pruning and Expectimax algorithms.
3. Reinforcement learning using the Q-learning algorithm.
4. Information-theory based algorithm, the entropy algorithms


In order to make the project more intresting we made different variations of Wordle.

### Results
The results achieved from all the different methods can be found in our report ```AllOverTheWordle-Report.pdf``` 


## How to use
The code can be found in the ```AI-Wordle-Project``` reposiroty.

### To run the code
1. Run the command ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
2. Run ```python3 main.py``` to start the game.
